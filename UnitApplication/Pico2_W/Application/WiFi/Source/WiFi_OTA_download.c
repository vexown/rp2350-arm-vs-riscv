         * Attempt to read and decrypt application data received from the peer (OTA server) via the established secure TLS session (`ssl_context`).
         * 
         * How it works internally:
         * 1. Checks if there's already decrypted application data buffered within the `ssl_context`. 
         *    If yes, it copies up to `sizeof(decrypted_data_buffer)` bytes into `decrypted_data_buffer` and returns the amount copied.
         *    (Internal input mbedTLS buffer has size `MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_BUFFER_SIZE` - typically around 16KB, same as output buffer).
         * 2. If no decrypted data is buffered, it needs to read encrypted data from the underlying network transport. It does this by calling 
         *    the receive callback function that was registered using `mbedtls_ssl_set_bio` (in our case, `tcp_receive_mbedtls_callback`).
         * 3. The `tcp_receive_mbedtls_callback` attempts to read data from the TCP socket using our lwIP-based TCP stack.
         * 4. If the callback returns encrypted data, `mbedtls_ssl_read` processes the TLS record(s): it decrypts the payload and verifies its integrity.
         * 5. If the decrypted data is application data (like the HTTP response body), it's copied to the provided `decrypted_data_buffer`.
         * 6. If the received TLS record is a control message (e.g., a re-handshake request or an alert), mbedTLS handles it internally. 
         *    `mbedtls_ssl_read` might then return a non-fatal error like `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_READ` to indicate that the application should 
         *    call it again after the internal processing is complete or more data is received.
         * 
         * Non-Blocking Operation:
         * Since we configured the BIO callbacks for non-blocking operation, `mbedtls_ssl_read` (and the underlying `tcp_receive_mbedtls_callback`) 
         * might not be able to read data immediately if none is available on the socket. In this scenario:
         * - `tcp_receive_mbedtls_callback` returns `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_READ`.
         * - `mbedtls_ssl_read` propagates this return value back to the caller.
         * This is not a fatal error; it simply means the application should retry the read operation later, allowing the network stack time to 
         * receive data. The `vTaskDelay` in the loop handles this. Similarly, `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_WRITE` could be returned if processing the 
         * received data requires sending a response (e.g., a TLS alert), but the send buffer is full. */

     *                 the OTA download process from any other potential RNG usage on
     *                 the device.
