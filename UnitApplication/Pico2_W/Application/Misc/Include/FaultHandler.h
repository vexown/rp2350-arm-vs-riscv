 * File: FaultHandler.h
 * Description: Captures crash context (HardFault registers, configASSERT, stack
 *              overflow, malloc failure) into the RP2350 watchdog scratch
 *              registers and reboots cleanly. After the reboot,
 *              FaultHandler_ReportLastCrash() prints what happened.
 * 
 *              The watchdog peripheral contains eight 32-bit general-purpose 
 *              scratch registers, SCRATCH0 through SCRATCH7, at offsets 0x0c 
 *              through 0x28 in the watchdog register block. Each one is plain RW 
 *              with a reset value of 0x00000000.
 * 
 *              The most important property of these scratch registers is that they retain
 *              their values across certain types of reset, including the software-triggered reset we use here.
 *              
 *              To be precise, based on the RP2350 datasheet, the value of watchdog scratch registers is...
 * 
 *              Preserved across:
 *
 *                  - Watchdog-triggered system reset (via PSM_WDSEL) — the typical case, including the SDK default and watchdog_reboot()
 *                  - Watchdog-triggered subsystem reset (via RESETS_WDSEL)
 *                  - Any other system or subsystem reset not caused by the watchdog
 * 
 *              Cleared by:
 * 
 *                  - Watchdog-triggered chip-level reset (via POWMAN_WATCHDOG)
 *                  - Any other chip-level reset (POR/BOR, glitch detector, debugger, etc.)
 *                  - rst_n_run event — toggling the RUN pin or cycling DVDD
 *
 *              Scratch register layout used:
 *
 *                  - scratch[0]    - reserved (existing watchdog reset counter)
 *                  - scratch[1]    = magic | fault-type
 *                  - scratch[2]    = primary datum (PC / line / 0)
 *                  - scratch[3]    = secondary datum (LR / file-hash / first 4 chars of task name as ASCII)
 *                  - scratch[4..7] - owned by the SDK/boot ROM - not for user data
 *                                    watchdog_reboot() writes a sentinel + PC/SP handoff here that
 *                                    the boot ROM consumes on the next reset, so
 *                                    these slots cannot be used for crash data.

 *              Fault types handled
 *              ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *              This module captures four kinds of fault. They split into two
 *              categories by *who* detects them:
 *
 *                A) Hardware-detected  -> the Cortex-M33 CPU itself raises an
 *                                         exception.
 *                B) Software-detected  -> FreeRTOS notices a problem and calls
 *                                         a hook function. The CPU is still
 *                                         running fine; the RTOS is reporting a
 *                                         programming/resource error.
 *
 *              (A) HardFault
 *              -------------
 *              A HardFault is a CPU exception - the processor hit something it
 *              physically cannot execute correctly and vectored to the
 *              HardFault handler. Typical causes:
 *
 *                  - Dereferencing a bad pointer (NULL, dangling, unaligned).
 *                  - Calling through a corrupted function pointer, or returning
 *                    to a corrupted address (jump to non-executable memory).
 *                  - Executing an undefined / illegal instruction.
 *                  - A bus error on an instruction fetch or data access.
 *                  - Divide-by-zero or unaligned access, when trapping of those
 *                    is enabled.
 *
 *              The Cortex-M33 also has finer-grained configurable fault
 *              exceptions (MemManage, BusFault, UsageFault, SecureFault). When
 *              those are not separately enabled - or a fault occurs while
 *              already handling a fault - they "escalate" to HardFault. Since
 *              this project installs only a HardFault handler, HardFault is the
 *              single catch-all for every CPU fault. It captures the stacked
 *              PC (faulting instruction) and LR, plus the CFSR/HFSR status
 *              registers, to pinpoint the cause.
 *
 *              (B) configASSERT failure
 *              ------------------------
 *              configASSERT() is NOT a CPU exception - it is a FreeRTOS
 *              assertion macro, the RTOS equivalent of the C standard assert().
 *              FreeRTOS sprinkles configASSERT() checks throughout the kernel
 *              to verify invariants and catch API misuse: e.g. a NULL queue
 *              handle, an interrupt priority outside the syscall-safe range, or
 *              calling a FromISR / non-FromISR function in the wrong context.
 *              You can use it in application code too. When the asserted
 *              condition is false, configASSERT() routes (via vAssertCalled())
 *              to FaultHandler_RecordAssert(). It is a deliberate, software
 *              tripwire that catches a programming error early - before it can
 *              snowball into silent corruption or a HardFault.
 *
 *              (C) Stack overflow
 *              ------------------
 *              Each FreeRTOS task has its own fixed-size stack. If a task uses
 *              more stack than was allocated for it, it overflows into
 *              neighbouring memory. There are two independent layers of
 *              detection on this platform, and each one is handled here:
 *
 *                1) FreeRTOS software check (configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW).
 *                   The kernel either bounds-checks the task's stack pointer
 *                   or verifies a known fill pattern at the end of the stack,
 *                   at every context switch. On detection it calls
 *                   vApplicationStackOverflowHook(), which routes to
 *                   FaultHandler_RecordStackOverflow(). This is best-effort
 *                   and only fires at context-switch boundaries (typically
 *                   every tick), so a fast overflow can outrun it.
 *
 *                2) Cortex-M33 hardware STKOF (Armv8-M Mainline).
 *                   The CPU has MSPLIM/PSPLIM stack-limit registers; the
 *                   FreeRTOS port sets PSPLIM to each task's stack base. When
 *                   SP would dip below the limit, the CPU itself raises a
 *                   UsageFault with CFSR.UFSR.STKOF set. This fires
 *                   synchronously and is what catches tight recursions in
 *                   nanoseconds. The HardFault handler in this module
 *                   detects this bit and routes the report to the stack
 *                   overflow output path so the post-boot summary stays
 *                   consistent across both detection routes (it tags the
 *                   source as "hardware STKOF" so the two can be told apart).
 *
 *              (D) malloc failure (heap exhaustion)
 *              ------------------------------------
 *              FreeRTOS allocates task stacks, queues, timers, etc. from its
 *              own heap via pvPortMalloc(). When a request cannot be satisfied
 *              because the heap is full, pvPortMalloc() returns NULL and, with
 *              configUSE_MALLOC_FAILED_HOOK enabled, calls
 *              vApplicationMallocFailedHook(), which routes to
 *              FaultHandler_RecordMallocFailed(). This is a resource-exhaustion
 *              report, not a crash - but it is captured so an out-of-memory
 *              condition is never lost silently.
