/* 
 * Function: vApplicationMallocFailedHook
 * 
 * Description: Hook called if a call to pvPortMalloc() fails because there is insufficient
 *  free memory available in the FreeRTOS heap.  pvPortMalloc() is called
 *  internally by FreeRTOS API functions that create tasks, queues, software
 *  timers, and semaphores.  The size of the FreeRTOS heap is set by the
 *  configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE configuration constant in FreeRTOSConfig.h.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - none
 * 
 * Returns: void

/* 
 * Function: vApplicationStackOverflowHook
 * 
 * Description: Run time stack overflow checking is performed if
 *  configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW is defined to 1 or 2. This hook
 *  function is called if a stack overflow is detected. 
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - pxTask: handle of the task in which stack overflow happened
 *   - pcTaskName: task ASCII identifier
 * 
 * Returns: void

/* 
 * Function: vApplicationIdleHook
 * 
 * Description: The Idle Hook function is called repeatedly by the idle task, which is 
 *   the lowest priority task in the system. This function can be used to 
 *   perform low-priority background tasks when the CPU has no other work 
 *   to do. It must not attempt to block or call any API functions that could 
 *   block because the idle task needs to run whenever no other tasks are 
 *   ready to execute.
 *
 *   Typical uses for the idle hook might include monitoring system status, 
 *   performing background tasks, or placing the CPU into a low-power mode 
 *   to conserve energy when idle. If not needed, this function can be left 
 *   empty.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - none
 * 
 * Returns: void
 */

/* 
 * Function: vApplicationTickHook
 * 
 * Description: The Tick Hook function is called by each tick interrupt.
 *   This function allows you to execute code at the frequency
 *   of the system tick (as configured by configTICK_RATE_HZ in
 *   FreeRTOSConfig.h).
 *
 *   You can use this function to perform periodic operations,
 *   such as monitoring system status, toggling LEDs, or
 *   incrementing software timers. Since this function is called
 *   very frequently, it is important to keep the code inside it
 *   efficient and quick to execute to avoid negatively impacting
 *   the real-time performance of the system.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   - none
 * 
 * Returns: void
