/*
 * @file button_debouncer.h
 * @brief Robust button debouncer using 8-bit shift-register pattern matching.
 *
 * @section Method
 *
 * A hardware timer ISR samples each registered button every DEBOUNCE_SAMPLE_MS
 * milliseconds, shifting the reading into an 8-bit history register.
 *
 * Instead of a naive delay or simple counter, a bitmask is applied to the
 * history so that only the oldest and newest samples matter — the noisy
 * middle bits are "don't-care." A press is confirmed only when the edges
 * of the history match the expected stable-high → stable-low transition
 * (or vice-versa for active-high buttons). Once detected, the history is
 * forcibly reset to a solid state, providing software hysteresis that
 * prevents re-triggering from residual chatter.
 *
 * This is the "Ganssle / Elliot Williams" approach: Defer logic, not Eager.
 *
 *
 * @section Tuning
 *
 * DEBOUNCE_SAMPLE_MS | History depth | Effective window
 * -------------------|---------------|------------------
 *  5 ms              | 8 samples     | 40 ms (responsive, good-quality switches)
 * 10 ms              | 8 samples     | 80 ms (safe for old/scratchy switches)
 *
 * History depth is currently 8-bit (uint8_t). If you encounter switches that
 * still double-trigger, prefer widening to 16-bit (uint16_t) over slowing the
 * sample rate — this doubles the window to 80ms while keeping the same 5ms
 * temporal resolution. Update the history field in Debounce_Entry and adjust
 * DEBOUNCE_MASK accordingly (e.g. 0xE007 for 3 oldest + 3 newest of 16 bits).
 *
 *
 * @section Usage
 *
 *   Debounce_Init();
 *   Debounce_AddButton(15, GPIO_PULL_UP, true);   // active-low with pull-up
 *
 *   while (1)
 *   {
 *       if (Debounce_Pressed(15))  printf("Button pressed!\n");
 *       if (Debounce_Released(15)) printf("Button released!\n");
 *       // ...
 *   }
